# HACKTOBERFEST 2022

Any contribution is welcome. See our [contributing guide](https://github.com/ayoayco/astro-reactive-library/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), and feel free to look around to find something that interests you. :)

Maybe add some themes to our form component? Or maybe an improvement for the README?

The [issues page](https://github.com/ayoayco/astro-reactive-library/issues) contains some ideas, but they should not limit your contribution.

If you don't find anything there, I'm happy to help you get your contribution in.
